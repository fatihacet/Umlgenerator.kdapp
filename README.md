About UML
------------------

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software engineering. 
The Unified Modeling Language includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems.

This application uses PlantUML as a service. You can find the details at PlantUML's home page. 
If you need more documentation about PlantUML, you can download PlantUML Language Reference Guide.
